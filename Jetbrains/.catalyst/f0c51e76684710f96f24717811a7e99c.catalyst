Hemose was very sad and had a bad day after the contest, but ZeyadKhattab is very wise and knows Hemose very well, and does not want to see him sad.</span></p><p>Zeyad knows that Hemose loves tree problems, so he gave him a tree problem with a very special device.</p><p>Hemose has a weighted tree with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$n-1$$$ edges. Unfortunately, Hemose doesn&apos;t remember the weights of edges.</p><p>Let&apos;s define $$$Dist(u, v)$$$ for $$$u\\neq v$$$ as the greatest common divisor of the weights of all edges on the path from node $$$u$$$ to node $$$v$$$.</p><p>Hemose has a special device. Hemose can give the device a set of nodes, and the device will return the largest $$$Dist$$$ between any two nodes from the set. More formally, if Hemose gives the device a set $$$S$$$ of nodes, the device will return the largest value of $$$Dist(u, v)$$$ over all pairs $$$(u, v)$$$ with $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ $$$\\in$$$ $$$S$$$ and $$$u \\neq v$$$.</p><p>Hemose can use this Device <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most $$$12$$$ times</span>, and wants to find any two distinct nodes $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, such that $$$Dist(a, b)$$$ is maximum possible.
