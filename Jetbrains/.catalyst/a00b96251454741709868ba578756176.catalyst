As you know, Hemose and his friends are problem solvers, so they are very clever. Therefore, they will go to all discount markets in Germany.</span></p><p>Hemose has an array of $$$n$$$ integers. He wants Samez to sort the array in the non-decreasing order. Since it would be a too easy problem for Samez, Hemose allows Samez to use only the following operation:</p><ul><li><p>Choose indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, and $$$\\lvert i - j \\rvert \\geq x$$$. Then, swap elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$.</p></li></ul><p>Can you tell Samez if there&apos;s a way to sort the array in the non-decreasing order by using the operation written above some finite number of times (possibly $$$0$$$)?</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.
