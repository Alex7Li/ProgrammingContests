DOUBLE.MIN_VALUE is a very small number... but more than 0.
Use DOUBLE.NEGATIVE_INFINITY.

When using a TreeSet, be careful! It will remove objects that
are considered to be equal by your comparator, even if those
two objects are equal according to your equals() method.

With loops that update an array, be careful with assignment.
We all know to copy arrays and not just move pointers around,
but it's easy to forget!
