# ProgrammingContests
This is my collection of solutions to programming problems.
It features problems primary from codeforces, with a fair collection of problems
from kattis and codechef.
Almost all problems have links in their name leading to the
location of their source. If the link is not there, the source can likely be
found by using the name of the class and the website (folder name).
I organized it into categories so that I can find problems relating to a certain
topic easily. Of course, many problems fit in other categories just as
well or better.
