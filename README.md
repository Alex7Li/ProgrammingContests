# ProgrammingContests
This is my collection of solutions to programming problems.
It features problems primary from codeforces, with a fair collection of problems
from kattis and codechef.
Almost all problems have links in their name leading to the
location of their source. If the link is not there, the source can likely be
found by using the name of the class and the website (folder name).
I organized it into categories so that I can find problems relating to a certain
topic easily. Of course, many problems fit in other categories just as
well or better.  

Update: This repo is now a bit of a mess, I tried to organize it but there were about 1000 files so I quickly got tired, then I tried to make a new repo with a new organization system... then later I swtiched to C++ and had another repo and went back to the first organization system... so yeah it's not looking great.
